# Final Project for the Course on Cyber-Physical Systems and IoT Security

The objective of this project is to implement the authentication protocol as described in
the provided reference paper. As well as that, we aim to provide an implementation of Secure Vaults, a storage
capability for keys.

The authentication protocol in use is a modulation of a three-way handshake protocol,
whereby both client and server challenge each other to provide means to authenticate
both parties.

1. At first the IoT device sends its device ID and session ID to the server. The device
ID is known by the server and validated.
2. If it is correct, the server generates a random number r1 and a challenge C1 and
sends both to the client.
3. The client generates a key k1 from the keys in the challenge C1, random values t1,
r2 and a challenge C2. It then encrypts r1||t1||{C2, r2} under k1 and sends it to
the server.
4. In the next step the server verifies the clientâ€™s message by generating the key key1
form the keys in the challenge C1 themselves. With k1 it decrypts the message
and looks whether r1 is in the message.
